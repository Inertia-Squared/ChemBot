{"image":"Y","question":"A solution of calcium chloride was mixed with a solution of sodium sulfate and a precipitate formed. A small sample of the solution above the precipitate was taken and diluted by a factor of 10.\n\nAtomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was used to measure the calcium ion concentration in the diluted solution. After constructing the graph below, the absorbance of the calcium diluted in solution was found to be 0.018.","correct":"C","data":{"questionID":"Question 11","paper":"CCSA 2020 Paper","outcomes":"CH12-15","band":"3-4"},"answers":[{"A":"Response A","B":"Response B","C":"Response C","D":"Response D"}],"marks":1,"type":"BMultiple Choice"}
