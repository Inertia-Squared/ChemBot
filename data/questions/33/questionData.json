{"image":"N","question":"A student carried out an investigation into the behaviour of cobalt (II) chloride when it is heated in an open test tube. The following extract is from the rough notes written by the student:\n\n1.\tA few spatulas of hydrated cobalt(II) chloride were put into a test tube. The cobalt(II) chloride was a pink solid.\n2.\tThe test tube was heated carefully using a bunsen burner flame. When heated, the cobalt(II) chloride gave off a vapour.\n3.\tThe solid was allowed to cool. When cooled, the remaining solid was blue.\n4.\tWater was added to the solid. The solid became pink, and the test tube became warm.\n\nBased on the information given, what should the student conclude?","correct":"A","data":{"questionID":"Question 1","paper":"NEAP HSC 2020","outcomes":"CH11/12-5, CH12-12","band":"2-3"},"answers":[{"A":"The procedure shows a reversible reaction.","B":"The procedure shows an equilibrium reaction.","C":"Cobalt(II) chloride is an ionic substance.","D":"Cobalt(II) chloride decomposes when heated."}],"marks":1,"type":"Multiple Choice"}
