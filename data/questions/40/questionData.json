{"image":"Y","question":"Ammonia reacts with oxygen gas using a platinum gauze catalyst according to the following equilibrium:\n\n 4NH[3] (g) + 5O[2] (g) <--> 4NO (g) + 6H[2]O (g) /\\H = -908kJ\n\nThe graph below shows a given amount of ammonia being reacted with excess oxygen in a closed system. Label 'A' on the graph is the calculated maximum theoretical amount of NO(g) that should be produced. Label B is the amount of NO(g) produced when the reaction is carried out at 250^C and Label C is the amount of NO(g) produced when the reaction is carried out at 350^C.

This is an equilibrium system, so completion does not occur. As the system achieves equilibrium, the rate of the forward and reverse reactions will be equal and concentrations of all species will be constant, as predicted by Le Chatlier's Principle."}
